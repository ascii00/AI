# Perceptron 
After starting the program, you need to enter the alpha - modification parameter, a reference to the data for the algorithm's learning "Train data" and the data for the algorithm test "Test data" in the format - "point1, point2, ..., class". A trained perceptron will be able to determine the class for the test data itself.
