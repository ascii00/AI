enough for an emergency.” Humans need 3 liters of water per day to be
comfortable. They gave us 50 liters each. There are 300 liters total in the
Hab.
Looks like I won’t be able to cover the whole surface of the Hab with
fertile soil. I’m willing to dedicate all but an emergency 50 liters to the
cause. That means I can feed 62.5 square meters at a depth of 10cm.
About 2/3 of the Hab’s floor. It’ll have to do. Anyway, I’ve only got a
paltry 5 square meters covered at the moment.
After that, things got disgusting. I spent three hours spreading shit on
Martian sand. I didn’t have to do it with my hands, at least.
I spread the sand out in a corner of the Hab, about 10cm thick. I
wadded up a few blankets and uniforms from my departed crewmates to
serve as one edge of a planter box (with the curved walls of the Hab being
the rest of the perimeter). Then I sacrificed 20 liters of precious water to
the dirt gods.
5 square meters was about right for the amount of manure I had
handy. I dumped my big container o’ shit on to the soil and nearly puked
from the smell.
That smell’s going to stick around for a while, too. It’s not like I can
open a window. Still, you get used to it. I mixed this soil and shit together
with a shovel, and spread it out evenly again. Then I sprinkled the Earth
soil on top. Get to work, bacteria. I’m counting on you.
In other news, today is Thanksgiving. My family will be gathering in
Chicago for the usual feast at my parent's house. My guess is it won't be
much fun, what with me having died 11 days ago. Hell, they probably just
got done gathering for my funeral.
I wonder if they'll ever find out what really happened.
LOG ENTRY: SOL 22
Wow. Things really came along.
I got all the sand in and ready to go. 2/3 of the base is now dirt. And
today I executed my first dirt-doubling. It's been a week, and the former
Martian soil was rich and lovely. Two more doublings and I will have
covered the whole field.
All that work was great for my morale. It gave me something to do.
But after things settled down a bit, and I had dinner while listening to
Johanssen’s Beatles music collection, I got depressed again.
Doing the math, this won’t keep me from starving.
My best bet for making calories is potatoes. They grow prolifically
and have a reasonable caloric content (770 calories per kg). I’m pretty
sure the ones I have will germinate. Problem is I can’t grow enough of
them. In 62 square meters, I could grow maybe 150kg of potatoes in 400
days (the time I have before running out of food). That’s a grand total of
115,500 calories, a sustainable average of 288 calories per day. With my
height and weight, if I’m willing to starve a little, I need 1500 calories
per day.
Not even close.
So I can’t just live off the land for ever. But I can extend my life. The
potatoes will last me 76 days.
Potatoes grow continually, so in those 76 days, I can grow another
22,000 calories of potatoes, which will tide me over for another 15 days.
After that, it’s kind of pointless to continue the trend. All told it buys me
about 90 days.
So now I’ll start starving to death on Sol 490 instead of Sol 400. It’s
progress, but any hope of survival rests on me surviving until Sol 1412,
when Ares 4 will land.
There’s about a thousand days of food I don’t have. And I don’t have
a plan for how to get it.
Shit.
Chapter 3
LOG ENTRY: SOL 25
Remember those old math questions you had in Algebra class? Where
water is entering a container at a certain rate and leaving at a different
rate and you need to figure out when it’ll be empty? Well, that concept is
critical to the “Mark Watney doesn’t die” project I’m working on.
I need to create calories. And I need enough to last four years. I figure
if I don’t get rescued by Ares 4, I’m dead anyway. So that’s my target:
four years.
I have plenty of multivitamins; over double what I need. And there’s
five times the minimum protein in each food pack, so careful rationing of
portions takes care of my protein needs for at least four years. My general
nutrition is taken care of. I just need calories.
I need 1500 calories every day. I have 400 days of food to start off
with. So how many calories do I need to generate per day along the entire
time period to stay alive for 1400 days total (the time till Ares 4 arrives)?
I’ll spare you the math. The answer is a cool 1000. I need to create
1000 calories per day with my farming efforts to survive until Ares 4 gets
here. Actually, a little more than that, because it’s sol 25 right now and I
haven’t actually planted anything yet.
With my 62 square meters of farmland, I’ll be able to create about
288 calories per day. I need to bring that up to 1000. I need four times my
current plan’s production to survive.
I need more surface area for farming, and I need water to hydrate the
soil. So let’s take the problems one at a time.
How much farmland can I really make?
There are 92 square meters in the Hab. Let’s say I could make use of
all of it.
Also, there are five unused bunks. Let’s say I put soil in on them, too.
They’re 2 square meters each, giving me 10 more square meters. So
we’re up to 102.
The Hab has three lab tables, each about 2 square meters. I want to
keep one for my own use, leaving two for the cause. That’s another four
square meters, bringing the total to 106.
I have two Martian rovers. They have pressure seals, allowing the
occupants to drive in ease, without spacesuits, as they spent long periods
traversing the surface. They’re too cramped to plant crops in, and I want
to be able to drive them around anyway. But both rovers have an
emergency pop-tent.
There are a lot of problems with using pop-tents as farmland, but they
have 10 square meters of floor space each. Presuming I can overcome the
problems, they net me another 20 square meters, bringing my farmland
up to 126.
126 square meters of farmable land. That’s something to work with.
Not nearly enough water to moisten the soil, but like I said, one thing at a
time.
The next thing to consider is how efficient I can be in growing
potatoes. I based my crop yield estimates on the potato industry back on
Earth. But potato farmers aren’t in a desperate race for survival like I am.
Can I get a better yield?
For starters, I can give attention to each individual plant. I can trim
them and keep them healthy and not interfering with each other. Also, as
their flowering bodies breach the surface, I can replant them deeper, then
plant younger plants above them. For normal potato farmers, it’s not
worth doing because they’re working with literally millions of potato
plants.
Also, this sort of farming annihilates the soil. Any farmer doing it
would turn their land into a dust bowl within 12 years. It’s not
sustainable. But who gives a shit? I just need to survive four years.
I estimate I can get 50% higher yield by using these tactics. And with
the 126 square meter farmland (just over double the 62 square meters I
have) it works out to be over 900 calories per day.
That’s real progress. I’d still be in danger of starvation, but it gets me
in the range of survival. I might be able to make it by nearly starving but
not quite dying. I could reduce my caloric use by minimizing manual
labor. I could set the temperature of the Hab higher than normal, meaning
my body expends less energy keeping its temperature. I could cut off an
arm and eat it, gaining me valuable calories and reducing my overall
caloric need.
No, not really.
So let’s say I could clear up that much farmland. Seems reasonable.
Where do I get the water? To go from 62 to 126 square meters of
farmland at 10cm deep, I’ll need 6.4 more cubic meters of soil (more
shoveling, whee!) and that’ll need over 250 liters of water.
The 50L I have is for me t
