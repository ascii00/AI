So that’s the situation. I’m stranded on Mars. I have no way to
communicate with Hermes or Earth. Everyone thinks I’m dead. I’m in a
Hab designed to last 31 days.
If the Oxygenator breaks down, I’ll suffocate. If the Water Reclaimer
breaks down, I’ll die of thirst. If the Hab breaches, I’ll just kind of
explode. If none of those things happen, I’ll eventually run out of food
and starve to death.
So yeah. I’m .....
Chapter 2
LOG ENTRY: SOL 7
Ok, I’ve had a good night’s sleep, and things don’t seem as hopeless
as they did yesterday.
Today I took stock of supplies, and did a quick EVA to check up on
the external equipment. Here’s my situation:
The surface mission was supposed to be 31 days. For redundancy, the
supply probes had enough food to last the whole crew 56 days. That way
if one or two probes had problems, we'd still have enough food to
complete the mission.
We were six days in when all hell broke loose, so that leaves enough
food to feed six people for 50 days. I’m just one guy, so it’ll last me 300
days. And that’s if I don’t ration it. So I’ve got a fair bit of time.
The Hab stood up to the storm without any problems. Outside, things
aren’t so rosy. I can’t find the satellite dish; it probably got blown
kilometers away.
The MAV is gone, of course. My crewmates took it up to Hermes.
Though the bottom half (the landing stage) is still there. No reason to
take that back up when weight is the enemy. It includes the landing gear,
the fuel plant, and anything else NASA figured it wouldn’t need for the
trip back up to orbit.
The MDV is on its side and there’s a breach in the hull. Looks like the
storm ripped the cowling off the reserve chute (which we didn’t have to
use on landing). Once the chute was exposed it dragged the MDV all over
the place, smashing it against every rock in the area. Not that the MDV
would be much use to me. Its thrusters can’t even lift its own weight. But
it might have been valuable for parts. Might still be.
Both rovers are half-buried in sand, but they’re in good shape
otherwise. Their pressure seals are in-tact. Makes sense. Operating
procedure if a storm hits is to stop motion and wait for the storm to pass.
They’re made to stand up to punishment. I’ll be able to dig them out with
a day or so of work.
I’ve lost communication with the weather stations, placed a kilometer
away from the Hab in 4 directions. They might be in perfect working
order for all I know. The Hab’s communications are so weak right now it
probably can’t even reach a kilometer.
The solar cell array was covered it in sand, rendering it useless (hint:
solar cells need sunlight to make electricity). But once I swept them off,
they returned to full efficiency. Whatever I end up doing, I’ll have plenty
of power for it. 200 square meters of solar cells, with hydrogen fuel cells
to store plenty of reserve. All I need to do is sweep them off every few
days.
Things indoors are great, thanks to the Hab’s sturdy design.
I ran a full diagnostic on the Oxygenator. Twice. It’s perfect. If
anything goes wrong with it, there is a short-term spare I can use. But it’s
solely for emergency use while repairing the main one. The spare doesn’t
actually pull CO2 apart and recapture the oxygen. It just absorbs the CO2
the same way the spacesuits do. It’s intended to last 5 days before it
saturates the filters, which means 30 days for me (just one person
breathing, instead of six). So there’s some insurance there.
The Water Reclaimer is working fine, too. The bad news is there’s no
backup. If it stops working, I’ll be drinking reserve water while I rig up a
primitive distillery to boil piss. Also, I’ll lose half a liter of water per day
to breathing until the humidity i
