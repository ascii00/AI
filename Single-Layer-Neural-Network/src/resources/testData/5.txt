The city is named after the river (old Russian: гра́д Моско́в, which means "the city next to the Moskva
River"). The beginning of the name is not known, but some people have a few ideas. One is that the name
might be from a very old Finnic language, in which it means "dark" and "cloudy". In 12th century tribes
of Vyatichi and Krivichs lived on that land. The first Russian reference to Moscow is from 1147 when
Yuri Dolgoruki called upon the prince of Novgorod-Severski to "come to me, brother, to Moscow."[16]

Nine years later, in 1156, Prince Yuri Dolgoruki ordered the building of a wooden wall, which had to
be redone many times, to go around the growing city.[17] After the attack of 1237–1238, when the Mongols
burned the city to the ground and killed its people living there, Moscow grew back and became the capital
of the Vladimir-Suzdal principality (an amount of land ruled by a prince) in 1327.[18] Its good place on
the start of the Volga River helped the city to grow slowly bigger and bigger. Moscow turned into a peaceful
and rich principality, known as the Grand Duchy of Moscow, for many years and a large number of people from
across Russia moved to live there.

Under Ivan I the city replaced Tver as a political center of Vladimir-Suzdal and became the only
collector of taxes for the Mongol-Tatar rulers. By paying high taxes, Ivan worked out an important
deal with the Khan. Unlike other principalities, Moscow was not divided among his sons but was passed
whole to his oldest. However, Moscow did not like the Mongol rule. In 1380, prince Dmitry Donskoy of
Moscow led a Russian army to an important victory over the Tatars in the Battle of Kulikovo. Only two
years later Moscow was raided by the Khan Tokhtamysh. In 1480, Ivan III finally broke the Russians free
from Tatar control, allowing Moscow to become the center of power in Russia.[19] Under Ivan III the city
became the capital of an empire that would eventually include all of Russia and other countries.

In 1571, the Crimean Tatars raided Moscow, burning everything but the Kremlin.[20]

In 1609 the Swedish army, led by Count Jacob De la Gardie and Evert Horn, marched from Veliky Novgorod
toward Moscow to help Tsar Vasili Shuiski. They entered Moscow in 1610 and stopped the revolution against
the Tsar, but left early in 1611. After that the Polish invaded. During the Polish–Muscovite War
(1605–1618) hetman (army commander) Stanisław Żółkiewski entered Moscow after he defeated the Russians
in the Battle of Klushino. The 17th century had lots of revolutions, such as the Salt Riot (1648), the
Copper Riot (1662), and the Moscow Uprising of 1682.

The plague of 1654–1656 killed half the population of Moscow.[21] The city stopped being Russia’s
capital in 1712, after the building of Saint Petersburg by Peter the Great near the Baltic coast in
1703. The Plague of 1771 was the last big plague in central Russia, killing 100,000 people in Moscow
alone. During the French invasion of Russia in 1812, the Muscovites burned the city and ran away, as
Napoleon’s army was coming near to the city on 14 September. Napoleon’s army, which was very hungry
and cold, had to leave and was nearly destroyed by the freezing Russian winter and some attacks by the army.
