Well that took a really long time. I’ve been at it all night with the
Hydrazine. But I got the job done.
I could have finished faster, but I figured caution’s best when setting
fire to rocket fuel in an enclosed space.
Boy is this place a tropical jungle now, I’ll tell ya.
It’s almost 30C in here, and humid as all hell. I just dumped a ton of
heat and 50L of water in to the air.
During this process, the poor Hab had to be the mother of a messy
toddler. It’s been replacing the oxygen I’ve used, and the Water
Reclaimer is trying to get the humidity down to sane levels. Nothing to be
done about the heat. There’s actually no air-conditioning in the Hab.
Mars is cold. Getting rid of excess heat isn’t something we expected to
deal with.
I’ve now grown accustomed to the alarms that are blaring at all times.
The fire alarm has finally stopped, now that there’s no more fire. The low
oxygen alarm should stop soon. The high humidity alarm will take a little
longer. The Water Reclaimer has its work cut out for it today.
For a moment, there yet another alarm. The Water Reclaimer’s main
tank was full. Booyah! That’s the kind of problem I want to have!
Remember the spacesuit I vandalized yesterday? I hung it on its rack
and carried buckets of water to it from the reclaimer. It can hold an
atmosphere of air in. It should be able to handle a few buckets of water.
Man I’m tired. Been up all night and it’s time to sleep. But I’ll drift
off to dreamland in the best mood I’ve been in since Sol 6.
Things are finally going my way. In fact, they’re going great! I have a
chance to live after all!

I am .... and I’m gonna die!
Ok, calm down. I’m sure I can get around this.
I’m writing this log to you, dear future Mars archeologist, from Rover
2. You may wonder why I’m not in the Hab right now. Because I fled in
terror, that’s why! And I’m not sure what the hell to do next.
I guess I should explain what happened. If this is my last entry, you’ll
at least know why.
Over the past few days, I've been happily making water. It’s been
going swimmingly. (See what I did there? “swimmingly”)
I even beefed up the MAV fuel plant compressor. It was very
technical (I increased the voltage to the pump). So I’m making water
even faster now.
After my initial burst of 50L, I decided to settle down and just make it
at the rate I get O2. I’m not willing to go below a 25L reserve. So when I
dip too low, I stop dicking with Hydrazine until I get the O2 back up to
well above 25L.
Important note: When I say I made 50L of water, that was an
assumption. I didn’t *reclaim* 50L of water. The additional soil I’d filled
the Hab with was extremely dry and greedily sucked up a lot of the
humidity. That’s where I want the water to go anyway, so I’m not
worried, and I wasn’t surprised when the reclaimer didn’t get anywhere
near 50L.
I get 10L of CO2 every 15 hours now that I souped up the pump. I’ve
done this process four times. My math tells me that, including my initial
50L burst, I should have 130L of water added to the system.
Well my math is a damn liar!
I’ve gained 70L in the water regulator and the spacesuit-now-
watertank. There’s plenty of condensation on the walls and domed roof,
and the soil is certainly absorbing its fair share. But that doesn’t account
for 60L of missing water. Something was wrong.
That’s when I noticed the other O2 tank.
The Hab has two reserve O2 tanks. One on each side of the structure,
for safety reasons. The Hab can decide which one to use whenever it
wants. Turns out it’s been topping off the atmosphere from Tank 1. But
when I add O2 to the system (via the Oxygenator), the Hab evenly
distributes the gain among the two tanks. Tank 2 has been slowly gaining
oxygen.
That’s not a problem, it’s just doing its job. But it does mean I’ve
been gaining O2 over time. Which means I’m not consuming it as fast as
I thought.
At first, I thought “Yay! More oxygen! Now I can make water faster!”
But then a more disturbing thought occurred to me.
Follow my logic: I’m gaining O2. But the amount I’m bringing in
from outside is constant. So the only way to “gain” it is to be using less
than I thought. But I’ve been doing the Hydrazine reaction with the
assumption that I was using all of it.
The only possible explanation is I haven’t been burning all the
released hydrogen.
It’s obvious now, in retrospect. But it never occurred to me that some
of the hydrogen just wouldn’t burn. It got past the flame, and went on its
merry way. Dammit, Jim, I’m a botanist, not a chemist!
Chemistry is messy, so there's unburned Hydrogen in the air. All
around me. Mixed in with the oxygen. Just... hanging out. Waiting for a
spark so it can blow the .... Hab up!
Once I figured this out, and composed myself, I got a Ziploc-sized
sample bag and waved it around a bit, then sealed it.
Then, a quick EVA to a rover, where we keep the atmospheric
analyzers. Nitrogen: 22%. Oxygen: 9%. Hydrogen: 64%.
I’ve been hiding here in the rover ever since.
It’s Hydrogenville in the Hab.
I’m very lucky it hasn’t blown. Even a small static discharge would
have led to “Oh the humanity!”
So, I’m here in Rover 2. I can stay for a day or two, tops, before the
CO2 filters from the rover and my spacesuit fill up. I have that long to
figure out how to deal with this.
The Hab is now a bomb.
Chapter 5
LOG ENTRY: SOL 38
I’m still cowering in the rover, but I’ve had time to think. And I know
how to deal with the hydrogen.
I thought about the Atmospheric Regulator. It pays attention to what’s
in the air and balances it. That’s how the excess O2 I've been importing
ends up in the tanks. Problem is, it’s just not built to pull hydrogen out of
the air.
The regulator uses freeze-separation to sort out the gasses. When it
decides there’s too much oxygen, it starts collecting air in a tank and
cooling it to 90 kelvin. That makes the oxygen turn to liquid, but leaves
the nitrogen (condensation point: 77K) still gaseous. Then it stores the
O2.
But I can’t get it to do that for hydrogen, because hydrogen needs to
be below 21K to turn liquid. And the regulator just can’t get temperatures
that low. Dead end.
Here’s the solution:
Hydrogen is dangerous because it can blow up. But it can only blow
up if there’s oxygen around. Hydrogen without oxygen is harmless. And
the regulator is all about pulling oxygen out of the air.
There are four different safety interlocks that prevent the regulator
from letting the Hab’s oxygen content get too low. But they’re designed
to work against technical faults, not deliberate sabotage (bwa ha ha!).
Long story short, I can trick the regulator in to pulling all the oxygen
out of the Hab. Then I can wear a spacesuit (so I can breathe) and do
whatever I want without fear of blowing up. Yay!
I’ll use an O2 tank to spray short bursts of oxygen at the hydrogen,
and make a spark with a couple of wires and a battery. It’ll set the
hydrogen on fire, but only until the small bit of oxygen is used up.
I’ll just do that over and over, in controlled bursts, until I’ve burned
off all the hydrogen.
One tiny flaw with that plan: It’ll kill my dirt.
The dirt is only viable soil because of the bacteria growing in it. If I
get rid of all the oxygen, the bacteria will die. I don’t have 100 billion
little spacesuits handy.
It’s half a solution anyway.
Time to take a break from thinking.
Commander Lewis was the last one to use this rover. She was
scheduled to use it again on Sol 7, but she went home instead. Her
personal travel kit’s still in the back. Rifling through it, I found a protein
bar and a personal USB, probably full of music to listen to on the drive.
Time to chow down and see what the good Commander brought along
for music.
LOG ENTRY SOL 38 (2)
Disco. God damn it, Lewis.
LOG ENTRY: SOL 39
Well I think I’ve got it.
Soil bacteria are used to winters. They get less active, and require less
oxygen to survive. I can lower the Hab temperature to 1C, and they’ll
nearly hibernate. This sort of thing happens on Earth all the time. They
can survive a couple of days this way. If you’re wondering how bacteria
survive long periods of cold on Earth, the answer is they don’t. Bacteria
further underground where it was warmer breed upward to replace the
dead ones.
They’ll still need some oxygen, but not much. I think a 1% content
will do the trick. That leaves a little in the air for the bacteria to breathe,
but not enough to maintain a fire. So the hydrogen won’t blow up.
But that leads to yet another problem. The potato plants won’t like the
plan.
They don’t mind the lack of oxygen but the cold will kill them. So I’ll
have to pot them (bag them, actually) and move them to a rover. They
haven’t even sprouted yet, so it’s not like they need light.
It was surprisingly annoying to find a way to make the heat stay on
when the rover’s unoccupied. But I figured it out. After all, I’ve got
nothing but time in here.
So that’s the plan. First, bag the potato plants and bring them to the
rover (make sure it keeps the damn heater on). Then drop the Hab
temperature to 1C. Then reduce to O2 content to 1%. Then burn off the
hydrogen with a battery, some wires, and a tank of O2.
Yeah. This all sounds like a great idea with no chance of catastrophic
failure.
That was sarcasm, by the way.
Well, off I go.

Things weren’t 100% successful.
They say no plan survives first contact with implementation. I’d have
to agree. Here’s what happened:
I summoned up the courage to return to the Hab. Once I got there, I
felt a little more confident. Everything was how I’d left it (what did I
expect? Martians looting my stuff?)
It would take a while to let the Hab cool, so I started that right away
by turning the temperature down to 1C.
I bagged the potato plants, and got a chance to check up on them
while I was at it. They’re rooting nicely and about to sprout. One thing I
hadn’t accounted for was how to bring them from the Hab to the rovers.
The answer was pretty easy. I put all of them in Martinez’s spacesuit.
Then I dragged it out with me to the rover I’d set up as a temporary
nursery.
Making sure to jimmy the heater to stay on, I headed back to the Hab.
Buy the time I got back, it was already chilly. Down to 5C already.
Shivering and seeing my breath condense in front of me, I threw on extra
layers of clothes. Fortunately I’m not a very big man. Martinez’s clothes
fit over mine, and Vogel’s fit over Martinez’s. These shitty clothes were
designed to be worn in a temperature-controlled environment. Even with
three layers, I was still cold. I climbed in to my bunk and under the
covers for more warmth.
Once the temperature got to 1C, I waited another hour, just to make
sure the bacteria in the dirt got the memo that it was time to take it slow.
The next problem I ran in to was the regulator. Despite my
swaggering confidence, I wasn’t able to outwit it. It really does not want
to pull too much O2 out of the air. The lowest I could get it to was 15%.
After that, it flatly refused to go lower, and nothing I did mattered. I had
all these plans about getting in and reprogramming it. But the safety
protocols turned out to be in ROMs.
I can’t blame it. Its whole purpose is to prevent the atmosphere from
becoming lethal. Nobody at NASA thought “Hey, let’s allow a fatal lack
of oxygen that will make everyone drop dead!”
So I had to use more a more primitive plan.
The regulator uses a different set of vents for air sampling than it
does for main air separation. The air that gets freeze-separated comes in
through a single large vent on the main unit. But it samples the air from
nine small vents that pipe back to the main unit. That way it gets a good
average of the Hab, and prevents one localized imbalance from throwing
it off.
I taped up eight of the intakes, leaving only one of them active. Then I
taped the mouth of a Hefty-sized bag over the neck-hole of a spacesuit
(Johanssen’s this time). In the back of the bag, I poked a small hole and
taped it over the remaining intake.
Then I inflated the bag with pure O2 from the suit’s tanks. “Holy
shit!” the regulator thought, “I better pull O2 out right away!”
Worked great!
I decided I not to wear a space suit after all. The atmospheric pressure
was going to be fine. All I needed was oxygen. So I grabbed an O2
canister from the medical bay. That way, I had a hell of a lot more
freedom of motion. It even had a rubber band to keep it on my face!
Though I did need a spacesuit to monitor the actual Hab oxygen level
(The Hab’s main computer was convinced it was 100% O2). Each
spacesuit knew how to monitor its own internal air, of course.
Let’s see... Martinez’s spacesuit was in the rover. Johanssen’s was
outwitting the regulator. Lewis’s was serving as a water-tank. I didn’t
want to mess with mine (hey, it’s custom fitted!). That left me three
spacesuits to work with.
I grabbed Vogel’s suit and activated the internal air sensors while
leaving the helmet off. Once the oxygen dropped to 12% I put the
breather mask on. I watched it fall further and further. When it reached
1% I cut power to the regulat
