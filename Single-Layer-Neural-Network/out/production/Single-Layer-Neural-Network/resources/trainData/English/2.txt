2 crew were on their way home.
The most important piece of the advance supplies, of course, was the
MAV. The “Mars Ascent Vehicle.” That was how we would get back to
Hermes after surface operations were complete. The MAV was soft-
landed (as opposed to the balloon bounce-fest the other supplies had). Of
course, it was in constant communication with Houston, and if there were
any problems with it, we would pass by Mars and go back to Earth
without ever landing.
The MAV is pretty cool. Turns out, through a neat set of chemical
reactions with the Martian atmosphere, for every kilogram of hydrogen
you bring to Mars, you can make 13 kilograms of fuel. It’s a slow
process, though. It takes 24 months to fill the tank. That’s why they sent
it long before we got here.
You can imagine how disappointed I was when I discovered the MAV
was gone.
It was a ridiculous sequence of events that led to me almost dying.
Then an even more ridiculous sequence that led to me surviving.
The mission is designed to handle sandstorm gusts up to 150 km/hr.
So Houston got understandably nervous when we got whacked with 175
km/hr winds. We all got in our suits and huddled in the middle of the
Hab, just in case it lost pressure. But the Hab wasn’t the problem.
The MAV is a spaceship. It has a lot of delicate parts. It can put up
with storms to a certain extent but it can’t just get sandblasted forever.
After an hour and a half of sustained wind, NASA gave the order to abort.
Nobody wanted to stop a month-long mission after only six days but if
the MAV took any more punishment we’d all get stranded down here.
We had to go out in the storm to get from the Hab to the MAV. That
was going to be risky, but what choice did we have?
Everyone made it but me.
Our main communications dish, which relayed signals from the Hab
to Hermes, acted like a parachute, getting torn from its foundation and
carried with the torrent. Along the way, it crashed through the reception
antenna array. Then one of those long thin antennae slammed in to me
end first. It tore through my suit like a bullet through butter and I felt the
worst pain of my life as it ripped open my side. I vaguely remember
suddenly having the wind knocked out of me (pulled out of me, really)
and my ears popping painfully as the pressure of my suit escaped.
The last thing I remember was seeing Johanssen hopelessly reaching
out toward me.
I awoke to the oxygen alarm in my suit. A steady, obnoxious beeping
that eventually roused me from a deep and profound desire to just .... die.
The storm had abated; I was face down, almost totally buried in sand.
As I groggily came to, I wondered why I wasn’t more dead.
The antenna had enough force to punch through the suit and my side,
but then it got stopped by my pelvis. So there was only one hole in the
suit (and a hole in me, of course).
I had been knocked back quite a ways and rolled down a steep hill.
Somehow I landed face down, which forced the antenna to a strongly
oblique angle that put a lot of torque on the hole in the suit. It made a
weak seal.
Then, the copious blood from my wound trickled down toward the
hole. As the blood reached the site of the breach, the water in it quickly
evaporated from the airflow and low pressure, leaving only a gunky
residue behind. More blood came in behind it and was also reduced to
gunk. Eventually, the blood sealed the gaps around the hole and reduced
the leak to something the suit could counteract.
The suit did its job admirably. Seeing the drop in pressure, it
constantly flooded itself with air from my nitrogen tank to equalize. Once
the leak became manageable, it only had to trickle new air in slowly the
relieve the air lost.
After a while, the CO2 (carbon dioxide) absorbers in the suit were
expended. That’s really the limiting factor to life support. Not the
amount of oxygen you bring with you, but the amount of CO2 you can
remove. In the Hab, we had the Oxygenator, a large piece of equipment
that could break CO2 apart and give the oxygen back. But the sp
