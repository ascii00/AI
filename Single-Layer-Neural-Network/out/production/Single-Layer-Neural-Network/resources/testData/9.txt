Jordan (Official name is the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan) is an Arab country located in southwest
Asia, within the Middle East, located in the southern part of the Levant region, and the northern
part of the Arabian Peninsula. Jordan is bordered by Syria to the north, Palestine and Israel to
the west, Iraq to the east, Saudi Arabia to the east and south, and the Gulf of Aqaba to the southwest,
where the city of Aqaba overlooks the Red Sea.

The capital of Jordan is Amman. Aqaba is the only sea port for Jordan. Jordan is named after Jordan
River, which passes on its western borders. Jordan is a country that combines different Arab cultures
and dialects, and no natural borders separate it from its Arab neighbors except the Jordan River and
the Yarmouk River, which form part of its borders with Palestine, Israel and Syria, respectively. As
for the rest of the borders, it is an extension of the Levant Badia in the north and east, the Influence
Desert in the south, and Wadi Araba to the southwest.

The terrain in Jordan varies greatly, the most important of which are the Ajloun Mountains in the northwest,
and the Shara Mountains in the south, the highest peak on Umm al-Dami Mountain is 1854 meters, and the
lowest point in the Dead Sea, which is the lowest point in the world.

In 1921, Prince Abdullah bin Al-Hussein established the Emirate of Transjordan with the help of Britain,
and it was then subject to British rule in the Mandatory region of Palestine. The system in the Hashemite
Kingdom of Jordan is a constitutional monarchy with a representative government. The king exercises his
executive power through the Prime Minister and the Council of Ministers, who, at the same time, are
accountable to the House of Representatives (elected) and the Senate (appointed by the king) who are
the legislative branch of the state. There is also an independent judiciary system.

Jordan is a founding member of the League of Arab States and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation.
Jordan is a sovereign constitutional monarchy, yet the king enjoys extensive executive and legislative
powers.

Jordan is frequently referred to as an "oasis of stability" in a turbulent region, given that it was
mostly unaffected by the violence that engulfed the region in 2010. However, the country's population
suffers from relatively high rates of unemployment and poverty.
