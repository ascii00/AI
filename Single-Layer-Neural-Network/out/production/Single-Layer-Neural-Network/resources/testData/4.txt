Many scholars see Dostoyevsky as one of the greatest psychologists in literature.[8] His works have
had a big effect on twentieth-century fiction. Very often, he wrote about characters who live in poor
conditions. Those characters are sometimes in extreme states of mind. They might show both a strange
grasp of human psychology as well as good analyses of the political, social and spiritual states of
Russia of Dostoevsky's time. Many of his best-known works are prophetic.[9] He is sometimes considered
to be a founder of existentialism, most frequently for Notes from Underground, which has been described
as "the best overture for existentialism ever written".[10] He is also famous for writing The Brothers
Karamazov, which many critics, such as Sigmund Freud, have said was one of the best novels ever written.
Demons

His attack on nihilism is in his great novel Demons, or The Possessed. Published in 1872, it is a
"dark comedy, cruelly funny in its depiction of high-minded intellectuals toying with revolutionary
notions without understanding anything of what revolution means in practice".[4]

The plot is a version of actual events at the time. A former teacher of divinity turned terrorist,
Sergei Nechaev, had written a pamphlet, The Catechism of a Revolutionary, which argued that any means
(including blackmail and murder) could be used to advance the cause of revolution. Nechaev planned to
kill a student who questioned his ideas.[4][11]

One of the characters in Demons confesses: "I got entangled in my own data, and my conclusion
contradicts the original idea from which I start. From unlimited freedom, I conclude with unlimited
despotism". This suggests that the result of abandoning morality for the sake of an idea will be t
yranny more extreme than any in the past.
